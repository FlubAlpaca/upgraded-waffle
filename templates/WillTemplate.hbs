THIS IS THE LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT of me, {{testator}} of {{testatorCity}},
{{testatorProvince}}.

1. REVOCATION

{{#if foreignWills}}
I revoke all my prior Wills and Codicils that are intended to dispose of my property (my “Nova
Scotia Property”) situated in Nova Scotia. If I have any Wills in any jurisdiction other than Nova
Scotia (“Foreign Wills”), those Foreign Wills are not revoked by this Nova Scotia Will. The
Foreign Wills will have effect concurrently with this Nova Scotia Will, but I revoke the Foreign
Wills to the limited extent that the Foreign Wills purport to have effect in Nova Scotia or apply to
any of my Nova Scotia Property.
{{else}}
I revoke all Wills and Codicils previously made by me.
{{/if}}

{{#if marriage}}
1.1 MARRIAGE

I make this Will in contemplation of my marriage to {{intendedSpouse}}, and I declare that it is my
intention that this Will shall not be revoked by that marriage.
{{/if}}

{{#if divorce}}
1.1 DIVORCE

Notwithstanding any rule of law or statutory provision to the contrary, including Section 19A
of the Nova Scotia Wills Act, I declare that all gifts, bequests, appointments, or powers of
appointment in this Will in favor of my spouse, {{spouseName}}, and any appointment of {{spouseName}} as executor,
trustee, or in any other fiduciary capacity, shall remain valid and enforceable, even if my
marriage to {{spouseName}} is subsequently terminated by divorce or declared a nullity.
{{/if}}

2. INTERPRETATION

Where used in this document,

(a) “executor” shall be interchangeable with the term “estate trustee with a will,” shall be
deemed to include “trustee” if a trust fund has been established, to be pluralized if more than
one executor has been named, and to include all genders as the context in each case
requires;

(b) pronouns shall be construed as meaning the singular or plural, gender, personal or body
corporate as the context in each case requires and "their" may be used in place of "his" or
"her";

(c) paragraph headings are for reference purposes only and shall not define, limit, extend, or
otherwise affect the meaning of any term or provision;

(d) “divide” shall be deemed to include “pay”, “transfer” and “deliver” as the context in each
case requires;

(e) the terms “surviving”, “survivors”, "survive me", "survives me", and "survived me" shall be
deemed to include only those alive on the thirtieth day after the date of my death.

(f) “child” or “children” means surviving biological or legally adopted children, unless
otherwise specified.

(g) “sibling" or “siblings” means surviving biological siblings, unless otherwise specified.

(h) "lineal descendant or descendants" shall be deemed to include those who have been
legally adopted, unless otherwise specified.

3. APPOINTMENT OF EXECUTOR

{{#if executorOne}}
[1 Executor]
(a) I appoint {{executor}} of {{executorCity}}, {{executorProvince}} to be the sole
executor of my estate.
{{/if}}

(a) I appoint {{executor}} of {{executorCity}}, {{executorProvince}}, and {{altExecutor}}
of {{altExecutorCity}}, {{altExecutorProvince}} as joint executors of my estate, with the
direction that they act together in all matters concerning the administration of my estate. They
must jointly make decisions and sign off on all actions related to the estate's administration,
ensuring unified management and execution of my will as per my wishes. However, if one of
these has not survived me, or at any time is unable or unwilling to act, then I appoint the other to
be the sole executor of my estate.

[2 Executors acting independently]
(a) I appoint {{executor}} of {{executorCity}}, {{executorProvince}}, and {{altExecutor}}
of {{altExecutorCity}}, {{altExecutorProvince}}, as co-executors of my estate, with
authority to act independent of each other. This grants either of them the power to make
decisions and take actions concerning the administration of my estate without the need for joint
approval, ensuring flexibility and efficiency in managing my estate as per my wishes. However, if
one of these has not survived me, or at any time is unable or unwilling to act, then I appoint the
other to be the sole executor of my estate.
{{/if}}

{{#if altExecutorOne}}
[1 Alternate Executor]
(b) If my executor first named has not survived me, or at any time is unable or unwilling to act,

executor of my estate.

[2 Alternate Executors acting jointly]

then I appoint {{altExecutor}} of {{altExecutorCity}}, {{altExecutorProvince}}, and {{alt2Executor}}
of {{alt2ExecutorCity}}, {{alt2ExecutorProvince}} as joint executors of my
estate, with the direction that they act together in all matters concerning the administration of my
estate. They must jointly make decisions and sign off on all actions related to the estate's
administration, ensuring unified management and execution of my will as per my wishes.
However, if one of these has not survived me, or at any time is unable or unwilling to act, then I
appoint the other to be the sole executor of my estate.
{{/if}}

{{#if altExecutorThree}}
[2 Alternate Executors acting independently]
(b) If my executor first named has not survived me, or at any time is unable or unwilling to act,
then I appoint {{altExecutor}} of {{altExecutorCity}}, {{altExecutorProvince}}, and {{alt2Executor}}
of {{alt2ExecutorCity}}, {{alt2ExecutorProvince}}, as co-executors of my
estate, with authority to act independent of each other. This grants either of them the power to
make decisions and take actions concerning the administration of my estate without the need
for joint approval, ensuring flexibility and efficiency in managing my estate as per my wishes.
However, if one of these has not survived me, or at any time is unable or unwilling to act, then I
appoint the other to be the sole executor of my estate.
{{/if}}

{{#if altAltExecutor}}
[Alternate Alternate Executor]
(c) If both my executors named above have not survived me, or at any time are unable or
unwilling to act, then I appoint {{alt2Executor}} of {{alt2ExecutorCity}}, {{alt2ExecutorProvince}}
as the sole executor of my estate.

and testamentary expenses and taxes that my estate is legally bound to pay, or to commute,
prepay or defer payment of such debts or taxes as my executor or executors may in his, her, or
their sole and absolute discretion consider advisable, and I hereby empower my executor or
executors to make any election, determination, or designation pursuant to the Income Tax Act or
any other taxing statute or any regulation pursuant thereto.

{{#if myChild}}
Notwithstanding any other provision herein, if any child of mine who has been given a benefit herein
dies before final distribution of my estate, leaving one or more lineal descendant or descendants
then alive, such deceased child shall be considered alive for purposes of distribution hereunder and

been entitled, if he or she had not so died, to such lineal descendant or descendants by representation.
{{/if}}
{{#if anyPerson}}
Notwithstanding any other provision herein, if any person, other than {{executor}}, who has been given a
benefit herein dies before final distribution of my estate, leaving one or more lineal descendant or descendants

or executors shall make the gift or distribution to which such deceased person would have been entitled, if he or she

{{/if}}

6. AGE OR OTHER DISABILITY

If any person who becomes entitled to any share in my estate is under the age of majority or is,
in the opinion of my executor or a qualified medical practitioner, mentally incapable of managing
their affairs, or is otherwise under a legal disability, my executor or executors shall hold that
person’s share upon trust and keep it invested. My executor or executors may, in their absolute
discretion, apply all or part of the income and capital of that share for the benefit, maintenance,
education, or general well-being of such person, as they consider advisable. If the person
becomes capable or reaches the age of majority, the executor or executors shall then transfer
the remaining share to that person. If the person does not become capable, the share may
continue to be held in trust for their lifetime, and upon their death, the remainder shall be
distributed in accordance with the terms of this Will or, if none are provided, as part of the
residue of my estate. The decision of my executor or executors in these matters shall be final,

income or capital as they consider advisable for the care, maintenance, or benefit of {{nameOfBeneficiary}},
who has a mental disability. {{nameOfBeneficiary}} shall have no legal right to demand payment of income or
capital. Upon the death of {{nameOfBeneficiary}}, any remaining trust property shall be distributed as a part of
the rest and residue of my estate.
{{/if}}

{{#if hensonTrust}}
6.1 HENSON TRUST FOR {{hensonBenificiary}}

If {{hensonBenificiary}}, is alive at the time of my death, and if in the opinion of my executor
or of a qualified medical practitioner, {{pronounOfBeneficiary}} is a person with a disability who is or may
become eligible for government benefits, including but not limited to the Nova Scotia Disability
Support Program (DSP), I DIRECT that the share of my estate to which {{pronounOfBeneficiary}} would
otherwise be entitled be held in a fully discretionary trust, to be known as the {{hensonBenificiary}} Henson
Trust, on the following terms:

1. Discretionary Authority:
The trustee shall have absolute and unfettered discretion to pay or apply all or any
portion of the income or capital of the trust for the care, maintenance, education,
comfort, or general benefit of {{hensonBenificiary}} as the trustee sees fit.
The beneficiary shall have no right to demand any payment, nor any enforceable claim to the
trust property.

2. Preservation of Benefits:
It is my express intention that this trust be structured so as not to disqualify {{hensonBenificiary}} from
receiving or continuing to receive benefits under any government program for persons
with disabilities, including the Disability Support Program, and this trust shall be
administered accordingly.

3. No Vested Interest:
{{hensonBenificiary}} shall not be considered to have a vested interest in the income or
capital of the trust, and all decisions regarding distributions shall be made solely at the
discretion of the trustee.

4. Duration of Trust:
This trust shall continue for the lifetime of {{hensonBenificiary}} or until such earlier time
as the trustee, in their discretion, determines it is no longer necessary for the purpose for
which it was created.

5. Remainder on Death or Early Termination:
Upon the death of {{hensonBenificiary}}, or upon the earlier termination of this trust as
provided in paragraph 4, any property remaining in the trust shall be distributed as part
of the rest and residue of my estate.

6. Trustee Powers:
The trustee shall have all powers necessary to administer this trust in accordance with
its purpose, including the power to invest trust assets, engage agents or advisors, and
make distributions in kind or in cash.

7. Alternate Trustee:
If the trustee appointed is unwilling or unable to act, I appoint {{altHensonTrustee}} of {{altHensonTrusteeCity}},
{{altHensonTrusteeProvince}} to act as trustee of the Henson Trust in their place.
{{/if}}

7. POWER TO INVEST

I authorize my executor or executors to make investments and otherwise deal with my estate
(including property held for persons below a stipulated age or under any other legal disability)
and to exercise any rights, powers, and privileges that may at any time exist with respect thereto
to the same extent and as fully as I could if I were the living sole owner thereof as he, she, or
they in his, her, or their absolute discretion consider to be in the best interests of my estate and
the beneficiaries thereof.

8. POWER OF SALE

I authorize my executor or executors to use his, her, or their discretion in the realization of my
estate with power to sell, call in, and convert into money any part of my estate not consisting of
money at such time or times, in such manner and upon such terms and either for cash or credit
or for part cash or part credit as he, she, or they may in his, her, or their uncontrolled discretion
decide upon, or to postpone such conversion of my estate or any part or parts thereof for such
length of time as he, she, or they may think best or to retain any portion of my estate in the form
in which it may be at my death (notwithstanding that it may not be in the form of an investment
in which executors are authorized to invest trust funds and whether or not there is a liability
attached to any such portion of my estate) for such length of time as my executor or executors
shall in his, her, or their complete discretion deem advisable, and my executor or executors shall
not be held personally responsible for any loss that may occur to my estate by reason of his,
her, or their so doing.

9. DISCRETION TO PAY OR DIVIDE

Except as herein expressly stated to the contrary, my executor or executors may make any
division of my estate or set aside or pay any share or interest wholly or in part in the assets
forming part of my estate at the time of my death or at the time of such division, setting aside, or
payment, and I declare that where there may be some question of the value of any part of my
estate my executor or executors may in his, her, or their absolute discretion fix the value of my
estate or any part or parts thereof for the purpose of making any such division, setting aside, or
payment, and his, her, or their decision shall be final and binding upon all persons concerned.

10. AUTHORITY BINDING

Any exercise by my executor or executors of the authority or discretion conferred on him, her, or
them shall be binding on all beneficiaries of my estate whether or not such exercise would have
the effect of conferring an advantage on any one or more of them at the expense of any other or
could otherwise be considered but for the foregoing as not being an impartial exercise by my
executor or executors of his, her, or their duties, powers, and discretions or as not maintaining
an even hand among the beneficiaries.

11. EXCLUSION OF BENEFITS FROM COMMUNITY OF PROPERTY

All income from property given by me to any beneficiary who is, at my death, a spouse within
the meaning of the relevant legislation shall be excluded from the net family property of such
beneficiary.

12. INDIVIDUALS OMITTED FROM BEQUESTS

I declare that I have given full and careful consideration to the needs, circumstances, and
relationships of each of my family members and any other individuals who may consider
themselves to be my dependents. I have also considered any moral or legal obligations that
may be said to exist under the Testators’ Family Maintenance Act or otherwise.

If I have made no provision, or only limited provision, for any such person in this Will, it is not
due to oversight, but is a deliberate decision made with full knowledge of the facts, and reflects
my considered judgment, having regard to all relevant circumstances, including any support or
gifts provided during my lifetime. It is my express intention that the dispositions made in this Will
represent the full extent of my testamentary obligations, both legal and moral.

{{#if independentSelfSufficient}}
Independent and self-sufficient

I have given careful consideration to the needs and circumstances of my child, {{omittedName}}, and
have intentionally chosen not to make any provision for {{omittedNamePronoun}} in this Will. {{omittedName}} is an
independent adult and is financially self-sufficient. I have no outstanding legal or moral
obligations toward {{omittedName}} beyond those already fulfilled during my lifetime. This decision
reflects my considered judgment and is not made out of forgetfulness or oversight, but rather as
a deliberate exercise of my testamentary freedom.
{{/if}}

{{#if substantialLifetimeSupport}}
Substantial lifetime support

I have provided substantial financial support and/or gifts to {{omittedName}} during my lifetime,
including {{supportDescription}}, and I have taken this into account in determining the provisions of this Will.
It is my intention that such prior support be considered part of their full share of my estate for the purposes
of determining whether I have discharged my moral and legal obligations.
{{/if}}

{{#if prolongedEstrangement}}
Prolonged estrangement

My relationship with {{omittedName}} has been distant and estranged for a significant period of
time. Despite reasonable efforts on my part to maintain contact and a meaningful relationship,
{{omittedNamePronoun}} has remained disengaged from me and the rest of the family. In light of this, and
after careful consideration, I have decided not to include {{omittedName}} as a beneficiary of my estate.
This decision is intentional and reflects the reality of our long-standing estrangement.
{{/if}}

{{#if prioritizing}}
Prioritizing those in need

In distributing my estate, I have given priority to those whom I consider to have a greater need
or whom I have supported more closely during my lifetime, including {{priorityNames}}. I believe this
allocation best reflects my moral and practical obligations. My decisions are based on
considerations of financial need, personal support, and the strength of my ongoing relationships.
{{/if}}

{{#if strongFinancialPosition}}
Strong financial position

{{omittedName}} is financially independent and in a secure financial position, with access to
significant income and/or assets. I have taken this into account in determining the distribution of
my estate. It is my belief that {{omittedName}} does not require any additional financial provision from me,
and my decision is made with this understanding.
{{/if}}

13. INTENTION WITH RESPECT TO JOINTLY HELD PROPERTY

It is now and always has been my intention that any and all property I hold in a joint tenancy
with another individual shall become the sole property of the surviving co-tenant upon my death.
I specifically intend for the survivorship rights associated with joint tenancy to apply to all such
properties.

14. LITIGIOUS BENEFICIARIES

If any person who may be entitled to any benefit under my Will, or the spouse of that person,
commences any litigation in connection with any of the provisions of my Will, other than for the
necessary judicial interpretation thereof, or at the discretion of the Court in the course of the
administration of my estate, all benefits to which that person would have been entitled shall
cease and I revoke all such benefits. I direct that these benefits so revoked shall fall into and
form part of the residue of my estate to be distributed as if the person had predeceased me and
had left no issue surviving me.
