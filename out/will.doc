<p style="margin:0 0 12pt 0;">I revoke all Wills and Codicils previously made by me.</p>
<p style="margin:0 0 12pt 0;">2. INTERPRETATION</p>
<p style="margin:0 0 12pt 0;">Where used in this document,</p>
<p style="margin:0 0 12pt 0;">(a) “executor” shall be interchangeable with the term “estate trustee with a will,” shall be deemed to include “trustee” if a trust fund has been established, to be pluralized if more than one executor has been named, and to include all genders as the context in each case requires;</p>
<p style="margin:0 0 12pt 0;">(b) pronouns shall be construed as meaning the singular or plural, gender, personal or body corporate as the context in each case requires and "their" may be used in place of "his" or "her";</p>

<p style="margin:0 0 12pt 0;">(b) If my executor first named has not survived me, or at any time is unable or unwilling to act, then I appoint Matthew Grey of Kingston, Ontario as the sole executor of my estate.</p>
<p style="margin:0 0 12pt 0;">4. PAYMENT OF DEBTS AND TAXES</p>
<p style="margin:0 0 12pt 0;">I direct my executor or executors to pay as soon as convenient after my death all debts, funeral and testamentary expenses and taxes that my estate is legally bound to pay, or to commute, prepay or defer payment of such debts or taxes as my executor or executors may in his, her, or their sole and absolute discretion consider advisable, and I hereby empower my executor or executors to make any election, determination, or designation pursuant to the Income Tax Act or any other taxing statute or any regulation pursuant thereto.</p>
<p style="margin:0 0 12pt 0;">5. DISPOSITION OF PROPERTY</p>
<p style="margin:0 0 12pt 0;">I give all the residue of my property, both real and personal, and including any property over which I may have a general power of appointment, to the executor or executors UPON THE FOLLOWING TRUSTS, namely:</p>
<p style="margin:0 0 12pt 0;">Personal articles</p>
<p style="margin:0 0 12pt 0;">(a) to divide all articles of a personal, domestic, or household use or ornament or works of art, not specifically referred to elsewhere in this my Last Will, in accordance with a list, memorandum, or letter signed by me, which I may leave among my personal papers or attached to a copy of this my Last Will;</p>
<p style="margin:0 0 12pt 0;">(b.1) to give and transfer the sum of $10,000 to the person selected by my Executor to care for any pets I own at the time of my death, with the request that the funds be used for the care and well-being of those pets. I leave this request to the discretion of my Executor and the selected caregiver;</p>
<p style="margin:0 0 12pt 0;">Rest and residue</p>
<p style="margin:0 0 12pt 0;">(c) to divide the rest and residue of my estate among my surviving children, share and share alike.</p>
<p style="margin:0 0 12pt 0;">Gift over</p>
<p style="margin:0 0 12pt 0;">(d) in the event my children fails to survive me, to divide the rest and residue of my estate among my surviving siblings, share and share alike.</p>
<p style="margin:0 0 12pt 0;">Common catastrophe</p>
<p style="margin:0 0 12pt 0;">(e) if, at any time, the disposition of any portion of my estate is not provided for by this Will, to give that portion to Bella Bistriteanu.</p>
<p style="margin:0 0 12pt 0;">5.1. SIMULTANEOUS DEATH</p>
<p style="margin:0 0 12pt 0;">In the event that Bella Bistriteanu and I die within 30 days of each other, it shall be presumed for the purposes of this Will and the distribution of my estate, that Bella Bistriteanu has failed to survive me.</p>
<p style="margin:0 0 12pt 0;">5.2. LINEAL DESCENDANT OR DESCENDANTS OF DECEASED</p>
<p style="margin:0 0 12pt 0;">Notwithstanding any other provision herein, if any child of mine who has been given a benefit herein dies before final distribution of my estate, leaving one or more lineal descendant or descendants then alive, such deceased child shall be considered alive for purposes of distribution hereunder and my executor or executors shall make the gift or distribution to which such deceased child would have been entitled, if he or she had not so died, to such lineal descendant or descendants by representation.</p>
<p style="margin:0 0 12pt 0;">6. AGE OR OTHER DISABILITY</p>
<p style="margin:0 0 12pt 0;">If any person who becomes entitled to any share in my estate is under the age of majority or is, in the opinion of my executor or a qualified medical practitioner, mentally incapable of managing their affairs, or is otherwise under a legal disability, my executor or executors shall hold that person’s share upon trust and keep it invested. My executor or executors may, in their absolute discretion, apply all or part of the income and capital of that share for the benefit, maintenance, education, or general well-being of such person, as they consider advisable. If the person becomes capable or reaches the age of majority, the executor or executors shall then transfer the remaining share to that person. If the person does not become capable, the share may continue to be held in trust for their lifetime, and upon their death, the remainder shall be distributed in accordance with the terms of this Will or, if none are provided, as part of the residue of my estate. The decision of my executor or executors in these matters shall be final, and the receipt of any person to whom a payment is made shall be a sufficient discharge.</p>
<p style="margin:0 0 12pt 0;">7. POWER TO INVEST</p>
<p style="margin:0 0 12pt 0;">I authorize my executor or executors to make investments and otherwise deal with my estate (including property held for persons below a stipulated age or under any other legal disability) and to exercise any rights, powers, and privileges that may at any time exist with respect thereto to the same extent and as fully as I could if I were the living sole owner thereof as he, she, or they in his, her, or their absolute discretion consider to be in the best interests of my estate and the beneficiaries thereof.</p>
<p style="margin:0 0 12pt 0;">8. POWER OF SALE</p>
<p style="margin:0 0 12pt 0;">I authorize my executor or executors to use his, her, or their discretion in the realization of my estate with power to sell, call in, and convert into money any part of my estate not consisting of money at such time or times, in such manner and upon such terms and either for cash or credit or for part cash or part credit as he, she, or they may in his, her, or their uncontrolled discretion decide upon, or to postpone such conversion of my estate or any part or parts thereof for such length of time as he, she, or they may think best or to retain any portion of my estate in the form in which it may be at my death (notwithstanding that it may not be in the form of an investment in which executors are authorized to invest trust funds and whether or not there is a liability attached to any such portion of my estate) for such length of time as my executor or executors shall in his, her, or their complete discretion deem advisable, and my executor or executors shall not be held personally responsible for any loss that may occur to my estate by reason of his, her, or their so doing.</p>
<p style="margin:0 0 12pt 0;">9. DISCRETION TO PAY OR DIVIDE</p>
<p style="margin:0 0 12pt 0;">Except as herein expressly stated to the contrary, my executor or executors may make any division of my estate or set aside or pay any share or interest wholly or in part in the assets forming part of my estate at the time of my death or at the time of such division, setting aside, or payment, and I declare that where there may be some question of the value of any part of my estate my executor or executors may in his, her, or their absolute discretion fix the value of my estate or any part or parts thereof for the purpose of making any such division, setting aside, or payment, and his, her, or their decision shall be final and binding upon all persons concerned.</p>
<p style="margin:0 0 12pt 0;">10. AUTHORITY BINDING</p>
<p style="margin:0 0 12pt 0;">Any exercise by my executor or executors of the authority or discretion conferred on him, her, or them shall be binding on all beneficiaries of my estate whether or not such exercise would have the effect of conferring an advantage on any one or more of them at the expense of any other or could otherwise be considered but for the foregoing as not being an impartial exercise by my executor or executors of his, her, or their duties, powers, and discretions or as not maintaining an even hand among the beneficiaries.</p>
<p style="margin:0 0 12pt 0;">11. EXCLUSION OF BENEFITS FROM COMMUNITY OF PROPERTY</p>
<p style="margin:0 0 12pt 0;">All income from property given by me to any beneficiary who is, at my death, a spouse within the meaning of the relevant legislation shall be excluded from the net family property of such beneficiary.</p>
<p style="margin:0 0 12pt 0;">12. INDIVIDUALS OMITTED FROM BEQUESTS</p>
<p style="margin:0 0 12pt 0;">I declare that I have given full and careful consideration to the needs, circumstances, and relationships of each of my family members and any other individuals who may consider themselves to be my dependents. I have also considered any moral or legal obligations that may be said to exist under the Testators’ Family Maintenance Act or otherwise.</p>
<p style="margin:0 0 12pt 0;">If I have made no provision, or only limited provision, for any such person in this Will, it is not due to oversight, but is a deliberate decision made with full knowledge of the facts, and reflects my considered judgment, having regard to all relevant circumstances, including any support or gifts provided during my lifetime. It is my express intention that the dispositions made in this Will represent the full extent of my testamentary obligations, both legal and moral.</p>
<p style="margin:0 0 12pt 0;">13. INTENTION WITH RESPECT TO JOINTLY HELD PROPERTY</p>
<p style="margin:0 0 12pt 0;">It is now and always has been my intention that any and all property I hold in a joint tenancy with another individual shall become the sole property of the surviving co-tenant upon my death. I specifically intend for the survivorship rights associated with joint tenancy to apply to all such properties.</p>
<p style="margin:0 0 12pt 0;">14. LITIGIOUS BENEFICIARIES</p>
<p style="margin:0 0 12pt 0;">If any person who may be entitled to any benefit under my Will, or the spouse of that person, commences any litigation in connection with any of the provisions of my Will, other than for the necessary judicial interpretation thereof, or at the discretion of the Court in the course of the administration of my estate, all benefits to which that person would have been entitled shall cease and I revoke all such benefits. I direct that these benefits so revoked shall fall into and form part of the residue of my estate to be distributed as if the person had predeceased me and had left no issue surviving me.</p>
<p style="margin:0 0 12pt 0;">IN TESTIMONY WHEREOF I have to this my last will and testament written upon this and three preceding pages of paper hereunto subscribed my name this "signingDay" day of "signingMonth", "signingYear".</p>
